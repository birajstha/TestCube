Coding Java Micro Service Assignment:
This test will not only test your Java skills but also your problem-solving and code organization ability.
You will write a Spring Boot application microservice that will calculate the size of a cube based on the volume.
The cube will return equal dimensions in length of x, y and z including a UUID and the date and time it was generated.
The cube object will be cached in memory for no more than 5 minutes.
You will then have another REST endpoint with the ability to save that cube object generated to a SQL or NoSQL database of your choice.
To retrieve created cubes you may look up the cube by the following:
    Query by UUID
    Query by volume
Query by matching volume of a custom dimension. Example: /dimension/4-4-4 or /dimension/2-2-16 would return a cube with the volume of 64 if it existed.
Write at least one unit test for the different levels of code within your sample project.
Also note other unit tests that could be created and why they would be useful.
You may use any additional Java libraries you wish. Gradle or Maven configurations will both be accepted.
Please place the code in a public git repository and give the URL when you have finished the exercise.
Someone should be able to clone, build and run your project. Also include any useful instructions inside README.md
